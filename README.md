# Dead-tree book tracker

During a Hackathon in 2015 at Balabit I was involved in a project to overhaul our library. Part of that project was
to make sure that the whereabouts of dead-tree books are tracked properly. This script is a piece of that puzzle: it's
basically a quick'n'dirty frontend that is accessible using QR codes on which people can just enter the location
of a book if they borrow it or put it back. The user side is not authenticated at all -- the system's built on honesty
anyway.
